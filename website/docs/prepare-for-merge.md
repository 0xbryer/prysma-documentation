[Prysm v3](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases/tag/v3.0.0) can be used to run a node on Mainnet using Merge-ready configuration. In this guide, we'll step through the tasks that you need to complete in order to be Merge-prepared.

<li><input type='checkbox'/><strong>Review "Before and now"</strong>: The next section gives you a high-level overview of the items that you need to keep in mind while preparing for The Merge. See the Ethereum.org [Merge announcement](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/08/24/mainnet-merge-announcement/) and [Merge readiness checklist](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/merge-readiness) for more detailed information.</li>
<li><input type='checkbox'/><strong>Ensure that you're using a merge-ready version of your execution client</strong>: You may need to use a prerelease version of execution client software. Refer to your execution client software documentation for the latest guidance.</li>
<li><input type='checkbox'/><strong>If you're using Geth, update now</strong>: Geth 1.10.22 contains a regression. Update to <a href='https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases'>v1.10.23+</a> if you haven't already.</li>
<li><input type='checkbox'/><strong>Ensure that you're using Prysm v3.0.0</strong>: If you've ever set the `USE_PRYSM_VERSION` environment variable, either clear this variable via `UNSET USE_PRYSM_VERSION` (Linux/MacOS) / `set USE_PRYSM_VERSION=` (Windows), or use `set USE_PRYSM_VERSION=v3.0.0` to ensure that Prysm uses Prysm v3.</li>
<li><input type='checkbox'/><strong>Verify your version</strong>: Verify that you're running Prysm `v3.0.0` by issuing the following command: `prysm.sh beacon-chain --version` (Linux) `prysm.bat beacon-chain --version` (Windows).</li>
<li><input type='checkbox'/><strong>Configure JWT</strong>: If you're not using IPC to connect your beacon node and execution node, ensure that both your execution node and beacon node are configured to use JWT authentication. These instructions are included below, and are also available here: [Configure JWT](./execution-node/authentication.md).</li>
<li><input type='checkbox'/><strong>Update your firewall</strong>: If you're not using IPC to connect your beacon node and execution node, your beacon node will need to connect to its execution node on port `8551`. Previously, port `8545` was used. Ensure that your firewall rules are updated accordingly.</li>
<li><input type='checkbox'/><strong>Configure a fee recipient address</strong>: If you're running a validator, configuring a fee recipient address will allow you to earn what were previously miners' transaction fee tips. Instructions are provided below, and also here: [Configure a Fee Recipient address](./execution-node/fee-recipient.md).</li>
<li><input type='checkbox'/>(Power users) Review the Ethereum Launchpad's [Merge config checklist](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/merge-configuration-checklist).

## The Merge: Before and now

<h2>Configure beacon node</h2>

If you're running a validator, specifying a <code>suggested-fee-recipient</code> wallet address will allow you to earn what were previously miner transaction fee tips. See <a href='./execution-node/fee-recipient.md'>How to configure Fee Recipient</a> for more information about this feature.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</div>

## Configure validator node (optional)

Other than ensuring that you're using the [latest stable Prysm release](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases), validator client configuration doesn't need to be updated for The Merge. A fee recipient address can optionally be configured on your validator node if you want redundancy or multiple fee recipient addresses. See [Configure a Fee Recipient address](./execution-node/fee-recipient.md) to learn more.

<div class="admonition admonition-caution alert alert--warning"><div class="admonition-content"><p><strong>Ensure that you're not running multiple instances of the same validator public key</strong>, especially if you're using scripts or other forms of automation. If the Ethereum network detects two instances of the validator key submitting proposals, attestations, or votes, it may assume malicious intent and slash accordingly.</p></div></div>

## Upgrade hardware

We recommend updating your hard drive to a 2TB+ SSD as soon as possible.

Youâ€™re now ready for The Merge. If you have any questions, feel free ask them on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/prysmaticlabs).

## Frequently asked questions

**I'm currently running a validator on Ethereum Mainnet. When should I make changes?** <br />
You can now make these changes, regardless of the network you're running on.

**Can I use IPC post-Merge?** <br />
Yes. You also won't have to worry about JWT if you use IPC. Refer to your clients' command-line documentation for IPC configuration parameters.

**Can I use a light node with Prysm, or do I need to run a full execution node?** <br />
No - at this time, a full node is required.
