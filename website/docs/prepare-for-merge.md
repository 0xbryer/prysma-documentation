[Prysm v3](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases/tag/v3.0.0) can be used to run a node on Mainnet using Merge-ready configuration. In this guide, we'll step through the tasks that you need to complete in order to be Merge-prepared. 


## Merge preparation checklist

Keep the following checklist in mind:

 - **Review v3 release notes in detail**: [Prysm v3](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases/tag/v3.0.0) introduces many updates, deprecations, and breaking changes. Review the [release notes](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases/tag/v3.0.0) to understand how this release impacts your configuration.
 - **Understand the high-level before and after**: The next section gives you a before/after picture of the items that you need to keep in mind while preparing for The Merge.
 - **Ensure that you're using a network-compatible version of your execution client**: You may need to use a prerelease version of execution client software. Refer to your execution client software documentation for the latest guidance.
 - **If you're using Geth, stay plugged in**: Geth 1.10.22 contains a regression that the team is actively working on. Update to <a href='https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases'>v1.10.23+</a> if you haven't already.
 - **Ensure that you're using v3.0.0**: If you've ever set the `USE_PRYSM_VERSION` environment variable, either clear this variable via `UNSET USE_PRYSM_VERSION` (Linux/MacOS) / `set USE_PRYSM_VERSION=` (Windows), or use `set USE_PRYSM_VERSION=v3.0.0` to ensure that Prysm uses Prysm v3.
 - **Verify your version**: Verify that you're running Prysm `v3.0.0` by issuing the following command: `prysm.sh beacon-chain --version` (Linux) `prysm.bat beacon-chain --version` (Windows).
 - **Configure JWT**: Ensure that both your execution node and beacon node are configured to use JWT authentication. These instructions are included below, and are also available here: [Configure JWT](./execution-node/authentication.md).
 - **Update your firewall**: Post-merge, your beacon node will need to connect to its execution node on port `8551`. Previously, port `8545` was used. Ensure that your firewall rules are updated accordingly.
 - (Power users) Review the Ethereum Launchpad's [Merge config checklist](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/merge-configuration-checklist).

Let's step through each of these changes. First, <strong>select a configuration</strong>:

import MultidimensionalContentControlsPartial from '@site/docs/partials/_multidimensional-content-controls-partial.md';

<MultidimensionalContentControlsPartial />

<div class='hide-tabs'>

<Tabs className="with-label hidden-in-jwt-guide" groupId="protocol" values={[
        {label: 'IPC', value: 'ipc'},
        {label: 'HTTP-JWT', value: 'jwt'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="ipc"></TabItem>
    <TabItem value="jwt">
    
<h2>Create JWT token</h2>

<JwtGuidancePartial />

    
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</div>

## Configure validator node

Validator client configuration doesn't need to be updated for The Merge. A fee recipient address can optionally be configured on your validator node if you want redundancy or multiple fee recipient addresses. See [Configuring a Fee Recipient Address](./execution-node/fee-recipient.md) to learn more.

Note that **consensus-layer Sepolia is a permissioned network** - you can run a beacon node on Sepolia, but not a validator.


## Upgrade hardware

We recommend updating your hard drive to a 2TB+ SSD as soon as possible.

:::tip Congratulations!

Youâ€™re now ready for The Merge. If you have any questions, feel free ask them on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/prysmaticlabs).

## Frequently asked questions

**I'm currently running a validator on Ethereum Mainnet. When should I make changes?** <br />
You can now make these changes, regardless of the network you're running on.

**Can I use IPC post-Merge?** <br />
Yes. You also won't have to worry about JWT if you use IPC. Refer to your clients' command-line documentation for IPC configuration parameters.

**Can I use a light node with Prysm, or do I need to run a full execution node?** <br />
No - at this time, a full node is required.
