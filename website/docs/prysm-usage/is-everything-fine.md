## Running the beacon node

### Common failures

#### Lack of peers

#### Node stuck during sync

## Running the validator client

### Common failures

#### Everything seems fine, but my balance is going down

If your validator client is running fine without errors but you're seeing your validator balance decrease, it is typically a sign your beacon node is either (a) crashed, (b) not synced to the chain head. This might also mean your beacon node doesn't have any peers and is likely not connected to anyone. If this still does not resolve your issue, you can get in touch with our team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hmq4y2P) anytime.
