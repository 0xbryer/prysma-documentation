One of the main design decisions of the Ethereum 2 project is performing the roll-out of the system over several phases. This decision has a serious impact on voluntary exits. Even though validators are able perform an exit in Phase 0 and Phase 1, they will have to wait until Phase 2 to be able to withdraw. This means their staked funds will be frozen until withdrawals are available, which should be around 2 years by current estimates.

:::caution
Make sure you understand that YOU CAN NOT WITHDRAW your staked GÃ¶ETH until Phase 2. If you still wish to perform a voluntary exit, please enter the below passphrase when using `accounts-v2 exit`

**Bye bye Eth2 :-(**
