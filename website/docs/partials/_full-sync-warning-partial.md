:::caution ETH + Fully Synced Beacon Node Required

Running a validator requires 32.1 ETH and a fully synced beacon node. Verify that your **beacon node and execution node are both fully synced** before proceeding. If you're not fully synced, you risk being penalized and losing some of your staked ETH.
