:::danger Ensure You Are Not Being Scammed
The correct address for the launchpad is https://launchpad.ethereum.org and the only, official validator deposit contract is [0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa). Do not send ETH directly to the contract, and only join by using the eth2 launchpad.
