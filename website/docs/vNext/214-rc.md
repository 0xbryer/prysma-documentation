[Prysm v2.1.4-rc.0](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases/tag/v2.1.4-rc.0) can be used to run a node on `Goerli-Prater` using Merge-ready configuration. If you'd like to Merge-test the `Goerli-Prater` [network pair](../concepts/nodes-networks.md), follow either of the following guides:

 - [Quickstart](../install/install-with-script.md): For users who are starting from scratch.
 - [Prepare for The Merge](../prepare-for-merge.md): For users who are already running a node.


...with the following adjustments in mind:

 - **Ensure that you're using a network-compatible version of your execution client**: You may need to use a prerelease version of execution client software if you want to Merge-test on the `Goerli-Prater` network pair. Execution client guidance is available [here](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/goerli), though we recommend referring to your execution client software documentation for the latest guidance.
 - **Tell Prysm to use the release candidate**: Prepend invocations of `prysm.sh` (Linux) or `prysm.bat` (Windows) with `set USE_PRYSM_VERSION=v2.1.4-rc.0` to ensure that Prysm uses the release candidate. For example: `set USE_PRYSM_VERSION=v2.1.4-rc.0 ./prysm.sh beacon-chain`.
 - **Configure JWT**: Ensure that both your execution node and beacon node are configured to use JWT authentication. These instructions are included in both of the above-linked documents, and are also available here: [Configure JWT](../execution-node/authentication.md).
 - **Verify your version**: Verify that Prysm is using the `v2.1.4-rc.0` release candidate by issuing the following command: `prysm.sh beacon-chain --version`.
