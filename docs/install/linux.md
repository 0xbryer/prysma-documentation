Prysm can be installed on GNU/Linux systems with either Docker (recommended) or using our build tool, Bazel. This page includes instructions for performing both methods.

**Have questions?** Stop by the [#documentation](https://discord.gg/QQZMCgU) channel on Discord and let us know.

## Dependencies

#### **For Docker installations:**

* A modern GNU/Linux operating system
* The `cmake` package installed
* The `git` package installed

## Installing the beacon chain and validator

The easiest way to install the beacon chain and validator is by running the `prysm.sh` script found in the main directory of the [Prysm repository](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm). Doing this will download the latest release of Prysm's binaries suited for the host system.

> **NOTICE:** It is recommended to open up port 13000 on your local router to improve connectivity and receive more peers from the network. To do so, navigate to `192.168.0.1` in your browser and login if required. Follow along with the interface to modify your routers firewall settings. When this task is completed, append the parameter`--p2p-host-ip=$(curl -s ident.me)` to your selected beacon startup command presented in this section to use the newly opened port.

### Running the Prysm startup script

1. Clone Prysm's [main repository](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) and enter the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm
cd prysm
```

2. Run the `prysm.sh` script with the recommended [startup parameters](../prysm-usage/parameters) by issuing the following command:

```sh
./prysm.sh -it -v $HOME/prysm:/data -p 4000:4000 -p 13000:13000 --name beacon-node \
  gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/beacon-chain:latest \
  --datadir=/data
```

It is also recommended to include the `--p2p-host-ip` and `--min-sync-peers 7` flags to improve peering. For advanced users that desire standard debugging tools found in the Busybox base image, append a `--debug` flag to enable them.

The `prysm.sh` script will now download and initialise the beacon chain with the specified parameters. The terminal will produce output like so:

```sh
./prysm.sh beacon-chain
Latest Prysm version is v0.3.3.

Starting Prysm beacon-chain
...
```

At this point, the beacon chain data will begin syncronising up to the latest head block. Please note that, depending on your network capacity and CPU, this process may take several hours.

  > **NOTICE:** The beacon chain must be **completely synced** before attempting to initialise a validator client, otherwise the validator will not be able to complete the deposit and **funds will lost**.

## Staking ETH: Running a validator client

  Once your beacon node is up, the chain will be waiting for you to deposit 3.2 Goerli ETH into a [validator deposit contract](../how-prysm-works/validator-deposit-contract) in order to activate your validator.

  To begin setting up a validator, follow the instructions found on [prylabs.network](https://prylabs.network) to use the GÃ¶erli ETH faucet and make a deposit. For step-by-step assistance with the deposit page, see the [activating a validator ](../prysm-usage/activating-a-validator.md)section of this documentation. For instructions on setting up multiple validators on a single machine, see the [../prysm-usage/wallet-keymanager](wallet keymanagers) section.

  It will take a while for the nodes in the network to process a deposit. Once the node is active, the validator will immediately begin performing its responsibilities.

  In your validator client, you will be able to frequently see your validator balance as it goes up over time. Note that, should your node ever go offline for a long period, a validator will start gradually losing its deposit until it is removed from the network entirely.

  **Congratulations, you are now running Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0!**

  ## Managing the beacon node

  To recreate a deleted container and refresh the chain database, issue the start command with an additional `--clear-db` parameter:

  ```text
  docker run -it -v $HOME/prysm:/data -p 4000:4000 -p 13000:13000 --name beacon-node \
    gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/beacon-chain:latest \
    --datadir=/data \
    --clear-db
  ```
