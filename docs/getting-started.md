## What is Prysm?

The [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) project is a full-featured client for the Ethereum 2.0 network written entirely in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org). Created by [Prysmatic Labs](https://prysmaticlabs.com), Prysm implements the official [Ethereum 2.0 specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs), which is the product of an ongoing collective research and development effort by various teams across the Ethereum ecosystem including the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org).

## This documentation

This manual is aimed at developers interested in participating in Prysmatic Labs's **public test network** known as the "Topaz" release and reviews the concepts behind the changes made in Ethereum 2.0, as well as the core components of the Prysm client itself. For more detailed information on the most recent research developments and understanding **what Ethereum 2.0 is**, it is recommended to review [Eth2Info](https://eth2.info) and the official [Ethereum 'Serenity' 2.0 specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs) repository.
